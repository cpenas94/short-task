      <h2>PhoneGap</h2>
      <p>Overview:</p>
      <p>
        PhoneGap is a framework that helps developers create mobile apps using web technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
        It allows you to build apps for different platforms (iOS, Android, etc.) using a single codebase, saving time and effort. 
        PhoneGap apps are packaged like native apps and can access device features like the camera or location using JavaScript.
      </p>
      <p>Advantages:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Easy to learn and use for web developers</li>
        <li>Can build applications for multiple platforms with a single codebase</li>
        <li>Good community support</li>
        <li>Access to native device features using plugins</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Disadvantages:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Performance is not as good as native applications</li>
        <li>Limited control over the native elements of the application</li>
        <li>Debugging can be challenging</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Flutter</h2>
      <p>Overview:</p>
      <p>
        Flutter is a framework developed by Google for creating mobile, web, and desktop apps using a single codebase. 
        It allows you to build visually attractive and fast applications with reusable components. 
        Flutter apps work on different platforms and have a consistent look and feel. 
        With Flutter, you can see changes to your code instantly without restarting the app, making development faster and easier.
      </p>
      <p>Advantages:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Fast development cycles</li>
        <li>High-performance applications</li>
        <li>Hot reload for quick development and testing</li>
        <li>Customizable widgets for building visually appealing UI</li>
        <li>Access to native device features using plugins</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Disadvantages:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Limited community support compared to other frameworks</li>
        <li>Steep learning curve for developers new to the Dart language</li>
        <li>Limited third-party library support</li>

      <h2>React Native</h2>
      <p>Overview:</p>
      <p>
        React Native is a framework created by Meta for building mobile apps using JavaScript. 
        It allows developers to create apps for both iOS and Android platforms using the same codebase. 
        React Native uses reusable components and provides access to device features. 
        It lets you write code once and use it across different platforms, saving time and effort.
      </p>
      <p>Advantages:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Large and active community support</li>
        <li>Fast development cycles</li>
        <li>Good performance compared to other hybrid frameworks</li>
        <li>Access to native device features using plugins</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Disadvantages:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Limited control over native elements of the application</li>
        <li>Limited third-party library support compared to other frameworks</li>
